        <h4>Forster Creek</h4>
        <p>
          Forster Creek is the most popular snowmobiling area around Radium Hot Springs and it is maintained by the Windermere Valley Snowmobile Society. A groomed trail leads to the club's cabin and four meadows where sledders of all skill levels can do some powder carving and boondocking. Experienced riders can venture beyond the meadows and get into high alpine lakes that offer incredible views of the area. From February 15 to May 31, sledders can also access Catamount Glacier.
        </p>
        <p>
          Staging is at the 19km Parking Lot. The Forest Service Roads to our staging area are active logging roads 7 days a week, logging trucks always have the right of way. Be aware that Forster Creek FSR is an unmaintained road and conditions vary daily.
        </p>

        <h4>Brewer Creek</h4>
        <p>
          Located 17 kilometres south of Invermere, Brewer Creek is a more challenging area. The terrain here consists of gorgeous meadows and high alpine bowls. Keep in mind, however, that this area is not maintained and that there are high avalanche hazards.
        </p>

        <h4>Rocky Point</h4>
        <p>
          If you are an experienced rider, you might want to venture out to Rocky Pointâ€”an advanced and unmaintained area located west of Brisco. Rocky Point is accessed along the Bugaboo Forest Service Road, and there are a number of slide paths along the steep climb, so use extreme caution if you are riding in this area.
        </p>

        <h4>Doctor Creek</h4>
        <p>
          This is a small and unmaintained area near Canal Flats. There is an older warming hut here that was originally the birthplace of the Windermere Valley Snowmobile Society. With several avalanche paths along the way, this area is not recommended for inexperienced mountain riders.
        </p>

        <h4>Paradise Mine</h4>
        <p>
          Paradise Mine is a privately maintained area by <a href="http://tobycreekadventures.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Toby Creek Adventures</a>.
